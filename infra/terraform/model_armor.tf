# model_armor.tf: the Model Armor guardrail template the `gcp` guardrail adapter screens
# through (rule R1).
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-04 / R1 (guardrail screening): adapters/gcp/guardrail.py screens the memo draft's
#         input and output through this template for prompt injection, jailbreak, sensitive-data
#         leakage and malicious URLs, in both directions.
#   P-05 (residency): the template is created in the region this repo runs in (local.region) and
#         called on the regional Model Armor host (config/settings.yaml model_armor.host), never
#         the global endpoint.
#
# template_id matches the default config/settings.yaml model_armor.template_id
# ("sanctions-screening-guardrail"), so a zero-edit boot names a template this file
# provisions, rather than an id nothing creates.
#
# The malicious-URI filter and multi-language detection are NOT served in every region: a region
# that refuses them fails the whole template with CAPABILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED rather than degrading,
# so both are gated on var.model_armor_full_capabilities (default false, slice 7 of the posture rule): a deployment in such
# a region sets it false explicitly and discloses the narrowed guardrail instead of failing every
# apply. See docs/gcp-service-region-availability.md upstream for which regions serve which.
