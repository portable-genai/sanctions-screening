"""Render this repo's Agent Plugins 1.0.0 directory from what it already declares.

Nothing here is hand-authored. Identity comes from the A2A agent card the repo already
publishes, keywords from what that card says the agent can do, and ``skills/`` from
``.agents/skills``. A manifest typed out by hand would be a second description of the service,
and a second description is one that can be wrong.

Agent Plugins packages TOOLING and carries no data-portability mechanism, so nothing here
touches the evidence trail: the ledger keeps its own export format, and a plugin only ever
REACHES it through the kit's read-only tools.

**Two parts are conditional, because a freshly generated repo has neither yet, and neither
absence is a defect.** Skills arrive when the maintainer's ``sync-skills.sh`` vendors them, and
an MCP server exists only once this repo declares a governed tool catalog and serves it. Both
are DETECTED rather than assumed: a repo that has grown either gets it in the manifest, and one
that has not renders a valid skills-only plugin instead of failing. Detecting beats a flag,
because a flag is a second place to remember.

Run it with ``make plugin``; the output is build output and is not committed.
