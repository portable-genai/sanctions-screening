"""GuardrailPort: the boundary that screens a generation call in both directions (rule R1).

Rule R1 is the reason this port exists: this service binds ``agent-guardrail-gateway`` as a
mandatory dependency, so every inbound prompt reaching a model must be screened BEFORE it reaches
one, and every outbound answer AFTER it is produced and BEFORE it is used. The one generation call
this service makes is the disposition-memo draft (``ports/narration.py``); the screening
service's ``_draft_memo`` step calls :meth:`GuardrailPort.screen` around it in exactly that shape.

The domain stays pure. This port names the screen; the adapters (not this module) depend on the
managed guardrail service (Model Armor) or a local heuristic stand-in.

        Never raises on a policy match: a block is reported as ``GuardrailVerdict(allowed=False,
        ...)`` so the caller can audit the attempt before deciding how to fail. An allowed verdict
        carries ``sanitized_text``, the text the caller uses from then on EXACTLY as given (the
        input unchanged when nothing was redacted, possibly empty when everything was); the
        caller never falls back to the unscreened original.

        Raising is reserved for the adapter being unable to decide at all: its backend errored
        or timed out, or the on-prem placeholder is bound. The domain treats every such raise as
        a refusal (fail closed) and audits it. The memo draft is optional here, so the refusal
        drops the model draft and the deterministic memo stands; it never admits the text.
